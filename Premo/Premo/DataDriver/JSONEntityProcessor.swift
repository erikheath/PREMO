     The main entry point for filling out (fulfilling) a managed object from a JSON representation. Create a new JSONEntityProcessor for each root object (essentially treat it as an operation). The processor manages state that should not be transferred from run to run.

     - Important: Beginning with this method, a recursive stack is created that traverses the relationships of an entity. One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many relationships are all supported. When objects refer to one another, infinite loops are prevented by the discrete nature of JSON files (i.e. they are not infinitely long) which are traversed from top to bottom and then are exited, as well as by keeping track of objects that have been created during the current processing run.

     However, an infinite loop can be set up by referencing transformable URL attributes that cause the downloading of JSON objects that refer to the object triggering the download. This can happen only if the file(s) that are downloaded describe a value for the transformable URL property in the referenced object. Simply referring to an object will not trigger a download of its transformable URL attributes, nor will setting any of its properties or attributes that do not trigger URL downloads.

     - Parameter managedObject: The managed object that should serve as the root object for applying the values contained in the valueSource dictionary.

     - Parameter valueSource: The data source that should be used for filling out the managed objects, beginning with the root object.

     - Parameter parentRelationship: If called in response to filling out a relationship of an object, the relationship that should be fulfilled.

     - Throws: In the event of an error, throws a Managed Object, Managed Object Context, JSON Parsing, or other related error.

    /**
     This is the entry point for the control flow that fulfills the relationships of an entity. This method supports to-one and to-many relationships.

     - Important: When processing the relationships, it's necessary to account for an error being thrown that should stop the processing of other relationships. As is not possible to determine ahead of processing the complete file whether a relationship will be valid, only non-validation errors occur during processing of the JSON collection. These errors are not recoverable and will cause the entire file to be discarded.

     Because of this, it is possible for the local cache to enter into an inconsistent state with the server, particularly if additional requests have been spawned. When file based parsing failures occur, consider resetting the local cache entirely, or design the database in such as way that responses to spawned requests will be discarded by not being able to be saved to the local cache.

     - Important: An object is not prevented from traversing back to the relationship that generated it. This means that if some or all of the definition of a parent object is contained in a relationship, the attributes will be processed and inserted into the parent object. The final value of an attribute is the last value for that attribute that is processed. This also means that attributes that are listed with empty values will overwrite any existing data in an object. If you do not want to overwrite an attribute value, ensure that the last value for the attribute in any nexted objects in the JSON file has the correct value.

     - Warning: This framework makes extensive use of Swift error handling to provide consistent and informative feedback. It also uses those errors to determine if processing is recoverable on a file to file basis. However, there are certain methods that can trigger the throwing of exceptions which are not handled by the Swift error system. Most of these are legacy methods that are being replaced with new implementations and/or signatures by Apple, Inc. Key-Value coding methods (specifically valueForKeyPath) are a known source of exceptions. This framework uses the runtime to manage as many of these known exceptions as possible. However, depending on the reliability of your data service, it may be necessary to manage exceptions generated from data processing that are specific to your implementation.

     - Parameter managedObject: The managed object that should serve as the root object for applying the values contained in the valueSource dictionary.
